Economics 120B
Econometrics, Winter 2025


Description: This course prepares students for empirical analysis   in an   academic   or business   setting. It covers   the   fundamentals   of   regression, including   estimation   and   hypothesis   testing   in   a   univariate and multivariate framework.    It presents ideas using the “potential outcomes”   framework   and makes the important distinction between prediction and causality. The course discusses reasons why estimators may be biased or inconsistent, and how both randomized experiments and natural   experiments can be used to obtain causal estimates.
The material can be difficult and the workload substantial, particularly for those who find math   courses challenging.    However, your payoff   for all this work is a set   of   skills,   analytical   tools,   and ways of   thinking about data that are extremely useful and   in high   demand   in   the marketplace.

Class will be held in person and attendance is strongly encouraged. Class   lectures   will not be recorded; if   you miss a class, the best option is to find   a   classmate   who   can   share notes   and   fill   you in on what you missed and/or to visit a TA during   office hours   for   extra   help.   We   will   also   have some in-class “bonus” quizzes which can only be   completed by   attending   class.

Feel free to stop by in person   so that I   can   get   to   know you.      As   these   are   large   classes,   I will   prioritize speaking with students about things which the TAs cannot help with,   such   as   strategies   to do better in the course, unusual circumstances, graduate school options,   etc.   In   other   words,   while I am happy to talk about homework, if   there are any   students needing to talk   about   other things, then   they   will   jump   to   the   front   of   the   queue.
Graduate Teaching Assistants: Maddison Erbabian, Kurtis Gilliat, Alec Hoover, Haoyu Wei   Undergraduate Instructional Assistants: Varun Naik, Ryan Zhao
The graduate TAs are a valuable resource, and I encourage you to   take   advantage   of   their   help   during their office hours. This is an excellent resource for   help   in understanding   course   content,   homework assignments, and the   Stata programming package.    If   you have a general question   about the class, rather than a specific question about content, homework,   or   Stata   (which you   should   ask   about   during   TA   office   hours), please   use   the   class   email   eco120b@gmail.com.   A   graduate TA will monitor this email, and forward anything which they cannot   answer to me.


Please do not use the email built into canvas, as it will not be monitored.
The undergraduate assistants are also a great resource.    They will   also be holding   office hours   and   I encourage you to take advantage of   their help.    They have recently taken the class, and   so   have   a   first-hand perspective about the types of   questions you might have and are well-prepared to answer homework and class questions.
Details on the office hours of   the TAs and UIAs will be   announced in   Canvas. The   current plan   is to have at least some, and perhaps all,   office hours via   zoom.      TA   and UIA   office   hours   will            start   on   week   two   of   the   quarter   unless   otherwise   noted.
Review Sessions: There will be review sessions each week which will be   conducted by a   graduate   TA.
The weekly review sessions will normally focus on helping students   get   started   on the   homework,   but will also occasionally review topics covered in class and help prepare   for   exams. You   are welcome   to   attend   any   of   the   review   sessions, regardless   of   which   one   you   are   registered   for.   Further details on review sessions will be provided during the first week of   class   and   announced   on   Canvas.
Class Web Site:    canvas.ucsd.edu
The class web site contains the syllabus, lecture notes, homework   assignments,   and   class   announcements.    You should check it regularly as you are responsible   for any   information posted   there in addition to any announcements made in   class.
Text and Online Videos:    For this course we will be using both a textbook and   online   videos.      The two
are not always substitutes for each other.      For   some   class   topics   the videos   are   the better resource,   while for others the textbook is better.    I will make sure to point   students to the most   appropriate         resource during class lectures.
Text: The textbook is the Pearson eBook   Introduction to Econometrics, 4th   Edition by   Stock and
Watson. The eBook access for the course is being delivered through Follett’s BryteWave RedShelf   as   a   link   on   Canvas.
The UCSD Bookstore has not provided information this year on specific details on how to   opt   out   of   purchasing   this   ebook.    If   you   have   any   questions   about   billing, etc., you   can   try   contacting
textbooks@ucsd.edu.
EVH Videos: We will also be using the Econometrics Video Handbook (EVH), a series of   videos developed and maintained by by Professors Brendan Beare, Eli Berman, Graham Elliot, Gordon Dahl, Yixiao   Sun, Kaspar   Wuthrich, Joe代 写Economics 120B Econometrics, Winter 2025Python

California   San Diego, in conjunction with IT   Services Educational Technology at UC   San Diego
and funded by an Innovative Learning Technology Initiative grant   from the   Office   of   the         President   of   the   University   of   California   (Melissa   Famulari   and   Joel   Watson, Co-Principal Investigators).You can access the EVH as a module on the   class web page.      There is no   charge   to   access   these   videos   as   part   of   this   course.    Some   of   these   videos   are   useful   to   review   concepts   you   learned   in ECON   120A, and some are useful for the material in ECON   120B.
Software:    Part of   the course involves learning to use a software package   called   Stata.    Stata   is   essential   for problem sets, so you need to be able   to   access Stata.
UCSD maintains a site license so that students   can   download   and   install Stata   on   their   own computer for free.    We will provide details on how to do this   as   a   separate   announcement   on   Canvas as soon   as possible.
You can also lease a copy   of   Stata to   install   on your own   computer   for   a   small   fee   (but   there   is   no   particular reason to do this since UCSD has a free site   license):

If   you would like a book to help you learn   Stata, a good suggestion is   A   Gentle Introduction to
Stata, Revised Sixth Edition, by Acock.    However, this book is not required for the course.    There are also many online sites devoted to helping individuals   learn   Stata.      For   a   list,   see:
https://www.stata.com/links/resources-for-learning-stata/
Homework:    Homework is an integral part of   this course, because the best way to learn   econometrics   is to do it.    I will periodically assign problem sets throughout the quarter.    These   assignments   will      be posted on the web, and it is your responsibility to check the class web page regularly.
Homework assignments will generally be due about 6 days   later.Your homework needs to be turned in on Canvas before midnight    (i.e., by   11:59 pm) on the due   date. Neither late nor emailed homework will not be accepted.    You must scan your answers into   a   single   pdf   file   and   upload   the   file   to   Canvas.
You are allowed to miss one homework without penalty, as I will drop the   lowest   score before   calculating   the   homework   portion   of   your   grade.    The   tradeoff   for   this   benefit   is   that   I   will   be strict about not accepting late homework.
Homework will be graded on a two-point scale.    A score   of 1 will be   given   to   homework   which has made substantial progress, but is incomplete.    A score of   2 will be given to homework which attempts   to   answer   all   of   the   assigned   problems, including   any   Stata   questions.
Students can work together on problem sets, although solutions must be written up and   handed   in   separately   (including   any   Stata   output, which   should   part   of   the   pdf   file   you   upload   onto   Canvas    when turning in your homework).    It is a good idea to attempt the problems   on your   own before meeting with a group.    While you can collaborate with others, any homework you turn   in must represent your own work.
Solution keys to the homework will be posted on the class web page.    It is a good   idea to   check   your answers versus the solution key so that you can   figure   out which   questions   you   need to understand   better.
Tests:       There will be a midterm and a final exam.    You   must   take   both   the   midterm   and the   final   exam   at   the scheduled time for the class you are registered for   (see   dates   and times   listed   earlier   in   the   syllabus).    There will be no make-up exams, and any conflicts or   emergencies   should be   approved by   me   in   advance   of   the   exams.    In   case   of   illness   or   accident   at   the   time   of   the   midterm   – with   proper documentation from, for example, a doctor – the final will   be weighted   90%.   Details   on   the   administration   of   the   exams   will   be   discussed   in   class.
Bonus Quizzes:    There will be between 5 to 7 “bonus”   quizzes   spread throughout the   quarter.      The   dates   of   these quizzes will not be announced in advance.    These are   short   quizzes, where you will   get         full credit for taking the quiz, even if   you do not get the   answer   correct.      You will need   to bring your phone to class to complete the quiz, and you must be physically present in the   class you   are   registered for to take the quiz.    There are no make-up bonus quizzes. The   way these bonus quizzes work is that for every bonus quiz you complete, your   final   exam   will   count   for   1%   less,   and instead you will get a full   1% towards your   course   grade.
Grades:    The following weights will be used to determine your course grade:   Homework:   15%
Midterm exam: 40%
Final exam: 38 to 45% (depending on how many bonus quizzes   are   completed)      Bonus quizzes: 0 to 7% (depending on how many bonus quizzes   are   completed)
Grading Policy:    If   you think a mistake was made in grading your exam, you may   ask   for   a regrade.      You   should submit your regrade request via Canvas within 7 days after exam   scores   are posted.    Note         that   unless   your   answer   is   fully   correct, the   assignment   of   partial   credit   is   a   matter   of   judgment,   and we are unlikely to change your grade since we want to   treat   all   class members   fairly.      From   past experience, most regrade requests do not result in a grade change.
